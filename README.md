# Facial Expression Detection

## Overview
This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect emotions from facial expressions in real-time using a webcam. The model is trained on the **Kaggle FER-2013** dataset, which consists of grayscale images of faces classified into seven emotion categories:

- **Angry**
- **Disgust**
- **Fear**
- **Happy**
- **Sad**
- **Surprise**
- **Neutral**

The model can accurately recognize these emotions in real-time, making it suitable for applications like mood analysis, audience reaction tracking, and more.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
- The FER-2013 dataset contains **35,887** grayscale images of size **48x48** pixels, distributed across the seven emotion categories mentioned above.

## Model
- Built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
- Utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture.
- Achieved an accuracy of **67%** on the test dataset.
- The trained model is saved as a `.h5` file for future use.

## Python Packages
The following Python packages are required to run the project:

- **TensorFlow** (for building and training the CNN model)
- **Keras** (for model utilities and preprocessing)
- **OpenCV** (for real-time webcam functionality)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Pandas** (for handling dataframes)
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting graphs, if needed)
- **Keras-Preprocessing** (for image data augmentation)
- **Kaggle** (for downloading datasets directly from Kaggle)

### Installation
To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python-headless numpy pandas matplotlib keras_preprocessing kaggle
```

### Kaggle API Setup
To download the FER-2013 dataset directly from Kaggle:

1. Go to your [Kaggle Account](https://www.kaggle.com/account).
2. Download your `kaggle.json` file (API credentials).
3. Run the following commands to set up Kaggle API:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
   mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
   chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```

4. Download the dataset:

   ```bash
   kaggle datasets download -d msambare/fer2013
   unzip fer2013.zip
   ```

## Files in This Repository

- **`final_emotion_detection_model67.h5`**: Trained CNN model with 67% accuracy.
- **`final_facial_expression_model_CNN.py`**: Python script used for training the model on the FER-2013 dataset.
- **`webcam.py`**: Script for real-time emotion detection using a webcam.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

## Usage

### 1. Training the Model
To train the model on the **FER-2013** dataset, run:

```bash
python final_facial_expression_model_CNN.py
```

### 2. Real-Time Emotion Detection
To perform real-time emotion detection using your webcam, run:

```bash
python webcam.py
```

Ensure that your webcam is properly connected and accessible.

### 3. Using the Pre-Trained Model
If you want to use the pre-trained model (`final_emotion_detection_model67.h5`) directly:

```bash
python webcam.py --model final_emotion_detection_model67.h5
```

## Results
The model was trained on the **FER-2013** dataset and achieved the following accuracy:

- **Training Accuracy**: ~70%
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~67%

### Sample Results of Real-Time Detection:
| Emotion  | Detected in Real-Time |
|----------|-----------------------|
| Happy    | ✅                   |
| Sad      | ✅                   |
| Angry    | ✅                   |
| Surprise | ✅                   |
